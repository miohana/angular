# Learning Angular (v2.x e v4.x)
I made an angular course, taught by [Loiane Groner](https://github.com/loiane) some months ago.

## Why am I sharing this?
The archives and the course content were in a folder in my computer, and weren't shared anywhere. So, I realized that sharing on **GitHub** :octocat: I could help people interested in learn this technology.
So, _here it is!_

## Credits
All the credits goes to [Loiane Groner](https://github.com/loiane), who provided the great content. If you want to learn as I did, go to her page and see her courses:

**Have a nice learn!** :computer: :books:
